        <p>After inducing a crippling career crisis after logging into LinkedIn for the first time in at least 6 months, Kyenmie 
          found herself questioning if she really liked anything anymore and if there was any fulfilment left to be had in life 
          (besides from seeing her bf on the weekends).

        <p>Wasn't going to a better school, getting into and graduating uni and getting a tech job doing frontend development 
          always the end goal? If so, why did it feel like the journey to get here was a lot better than the destination? And why
        was the thought of moving to a better job, a better career so paralyzing?</p>
        <p>Maybe it was just comfy to stay in the same position. Maybe it was the anxiety alarm bells ringing. Or maybe it was just laziness, onset by hours of endless doomscrolling. </p>
        <p>But there are many things to be enjoy in life!</p>
